# A history of the development of this website
#### for the purpose of guiding a successor in understanding the development.

This site was started with the default Gatsby starter

Coding was done using VSCode

6/18/22 I added TailwindCSS
- https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/gatsby

6/19/22 Set up continuous deployment workflow from my PC to GitHub to Netlify.
Removed much of the unused Gatsby content and replaced some of it with SEO, Layout and header changes

To follow development changes see the git logs.
